# Digital Twin App


## Overview

Digital Twin App is a comprehensive home monitoring system designed to enhance patient safety and security within a home environment. It leverages a combination of sensor data, machine learning models, and real-time monitoring to detect emergencies, burglaries, and analyze motion patterns. The system is modular, scalable, and built with a focus on reliability and ease of deployment.

## Architecture

### Design Choices

1. **Microservices Architecture**: The project is divided into distinct modules (`actuation`, `modeling`, `monitoring`, `viz-component`, `homecare-hub-main`)

2. **Containerization with Docker**: Each module has its own `Dockerfile`, enabling isolated environments and simplifying the deployment process.

3. **Kubernetes for Orchestration**: Kubernetes manifests (`k8s/` directories) are provided for orchestrating containers, ensuring high availability and scalability.

4. **FastAPI for APIs**: Utilizes FastAPI to create asynchronous, high-performance APIs for handling various functionalities like emergency detection and model training.

5. **MinIO for Object Storage**: Chosen for its compatibility with S3 APIs, MinIO is used to store machine learning models and other artifacts.

6. **InfluxDB for Time-Series Data**: Selected for efficient storage and querying of sensor data, enabling real-time analytics and monitoring.

7. **Vue.js and Nuxt.js for Frontend**: Provides a responsive and dynamic user interface for interacting with the HomeCare Hub system.

8. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implements logging mechanisms (`log.log`, `my_app.log`) to facilitate debugging and system monitoring.

The `create_burglary_message` function generates a formatted message based on burglary detection results. Here are the possible messages:

- **Burglary Detected**:
    ```
    üöî **Burglary Alert!** üöî
    Potential burglary detected with the following details:

    üîπ **From:** [from_room] ‚û°Ô∏è **To:** [to_room]
    üî∏ **Leave Time:** [leave_time]
    üî∏ **Enter Time:** [enter_time]

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Please check the premises immediately. ‚ö†Ô∏è
    ```

- **No Anomalies Detected**:
    ```
    ‚úÖ **All Clear!** No unusual activities detected.
    Everything is normal. Have a great day! üòä
    ```

#### Emergency Notification

The `detect_emergency` function generates a formatted message based on emergency detection results. Here are the possible messages:

- **Emergency Detected**:
    ```
    üö® Emergency Alert! üö®
    Room: [room].
    Patient has spent [duration] here.
    Expected duration (mean): [mean],
    Standard deviation (std): [std],
    Duration is outside the expected value with no variability allowed.
    ```

- **No Emergency Detected**:
    ```
    ‚úÖ All is well! ‚úÖ
    Patient is currently in [room] for [duration].

    ```

- **Configuration File**: `config.py` manages configuration settings, including IP addresses, intervals for model training, and sensor configurations. This file centralizes the configuration parameters required for the actuation module to function correctly.


## 2. Modeling

**Purpose**: Responsible for training and managing machine learning models for occupancy, motion, and burglary detection.

- **`main.py`**: Defines API endpoints for training occupancy, motion, and burglary models.
- **`occupancy_model.py`**: Contains functions for preparing data and training occupancy models.
- **`motion_model.py`**: Handles data preprocessing and training for motion analysis.
- **`burglary_model.py`**: Implements the burglary detection logic using Isolation Forests.

### Occupancy Model

**Purpose**: The `occupancy_model.py` script is designed to prepare sensor data and train models to predict room occupancy based on sensor readings.

- **`map_sensor_to_room`**: Maps sensor names to corresponding room or event labels.
- **`prepare_data_for_occupancy_model`**: Prepares sensor data for model training by converting timestamps, sorting data, and encoding sensor labels.
- **`calculate_times_in_each_room`**: Calculates the duration of time spent in each room or event based on sensor data. That Is done by following:

    1. Identifies room-change points and assigns group IDs.
    2. Calculates start and end times for each group.
    4. Computes the duration and duration in seconds for each group.
    5. Excludes all door-opening events from the results. (Door opening also triggers room change)

- **`train_occupancy_model`**: Computes the mean and standard deviation of time spent in each room to train the occupancy model.

### Motion Model

**Purpose**: The `motion_model.py` script is designed to preprocess sensor data and analyze motion patterns to train models for motion analysis.

- **`data_preprocessing_motion_analysis`**: Preprocesses the sensor data by parsing timestamps, identifying value changes, and extracting temporal features.
    - Ensures the 'timestamp' column is in datetime format.
    - Sorts the DataFrame by timestamp to ensure chronological order.
    - Creates a column to identify when 'value' changes and assigns a group ID that increments when 'value' changes.
    - Groups by 'group_id' and aggregates relevant information.
    - Calculates duration in seconds between enter and leave times.
    - Extracts temporal features from the enter_time.
- **`create_transition_dataframe`**: Creates a Transition DataFrame capturing movements between rooms based on consecutive different 'value' entries.
    - Handles special transitions like 'went out' or 'went to sleep' based on time gaps and time of day.
    - Initializes a list to store transitions and iterates through the DataFrame to capture movements.
    - Creates the Transition DataFrame and handles cases where 'from' or 'to' might be missing.
- **`train_motion_model`**: Trains the motion model by analyzing sensor data to identify movement patterns between different states.
    - Fetches sensor data for a specified time window.
    - Prepares the fetched data for occupancy modeling.
    - Processes the prepared data to analyze motion events and extract relevant features.
    - Creates a transition DataFrame to capture movements between different motion states.
    - Returns the transition DataFrame. Future enhancements should include training advanced models and storing them in MinIO.

### Burglary Model

**Purpose**: The `burglary_model.py` script is designed to detect potential burglary activities using Isolation Forests.

- **`class BurglaryDetector`**: Implements the burglary detection logic.
    - **`__init__`**: Initializes the BurglaryDetector with specified Isolation Forest parameters.
    - **`_feature_engineering`**: Performs feature engineering on the DataFrame.
    - **`train`**: Trains the Isolation Forest model on the provided DataFrame.
    - **`detect`**: Detects anomalies in the new motion data.
    - **`visualize_anomalies`**: Visualizes anomalies using a scatter plot.
    - **`save_model`**: Saves the trained model to MinIO.
    - **`load_model`**: Loads the trained model from MinIO.
- **`train_burglary_model`**: Trains the BurglaryDetector model using motion data and saves the trained model to MinIO.
