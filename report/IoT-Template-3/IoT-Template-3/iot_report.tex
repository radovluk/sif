\section{Background for grading (0.5 page)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{General overview of your schedule including longer leave of absence (e.g., vacations) to explain missing data:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I was on Christmas leave from 21.12.2024 to 2.1.2025.
		\item I was sharing the flat with another person and a cat, which made some tasks from this seminar harder to complete.
		\item Occasionally, there was also a third person in the flat (once or twice a week).
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Hardware problems:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item At the beginning of the semester, I encountered a problem with my ESPs that couldn't maintain a stable connection to the FRITZBOX router.
		\item I spent a lot of time trying to fix the issue, but I couldn't find a solution.
		\item In the end, I asked my landlord to give me the router credentials to debug the issue, which he refused.
		\item Instead, he provided me with a small router that I connected to the FRITZBOX. This solved the issue, and I was able to continue with the project.
		\item However, the router was not able to maintain a stable connection all the time and sometimes had to be restarted.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Credentials changed for the Digital Twin:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There were no credentials changed for the Digital Twin app.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Your setup at home (1 page)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Scale map and sensor placement:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Present the scale map with the placement of the sensor and the observed area.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Challenges from positioning:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Which challenges arose from their positioning.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Setup information:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Give any information necessary to understand your setup, for example, whether the apartment is only used by you or shared with a group of others.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Sensor Development (10 pages)}

\subsection{Challenges (0.5p)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Describe any aspect to consider while grading that impacted the development of your code, such as: programming skills, difficulties in understanding concepts, etc.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Limited experience with embedded systems programming, which required additional time to learn and understand the intricacies of hardware-software interaction.
		\item Initial difficulties in understanding the ESP32's deep sleep and wake-up mechanisms, which were crucial for power management in the project.
		\item Challenges in debugging hardware issues without access to advanced diagnostic tools, relying mostly on trial and error and online resources.
		\item Balancing the project workload with other academic responsibilities, leading to time management challenges.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sensor Integration (0.5p)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Integration of PIR and Magnetic Sensors}
	
	The integration of PIR sensors with a magnetic switch sensor was achieved through the following steps:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Hardware Configuration:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{PIR Sensor} connected to GPIO pin 27.
			\item \textbf{Magnetic Switch Sensor} connected to GPIO pin 33.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{GPIO Initialization:} 
		Both sensors are configured as RTC GPIOs with pull-down resistors to ensure stable low states when inactive.
		
		\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{c}
void configure_rtc_gpio() {
    // Initialize PIR sensor GPIO
    rtc_gpio_init(27);
    rtc_gpio_set_direction(27, RTC_GPIO_MODE_INPUT_ONLY);
    rtc_gpio_pulldown_en(27);
    
    // Initialize Magnetic Switch GPIO
    rtc_gpio_init(33);
    rtc_gpio_set_direction(33, RTC_GPIO_MODE_INPUT_ONLY);
    rtc_gpio_pulldown_en(33);
}
		\end{minted}
		
		\item \textbf{Wake-Up Configuration:} 
		Both sensors are set as wake-up sources using the EXT1 mechanism, allowing the ESP32 to wake from deep sleep when either sensor is triggered.
		\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{c}
uint64_t wakeup_pins = (1ULL << 27) | (1ULL << 33);
esp_sleep_enable_ext1_wakeup(wakeup_pins, ESP_EXT1_WAKEUP_ANY_HIGH);
		\end{minted}
		
		\item \textbf{Event Handling:} 
		Upon wake-up, the system identifies which sensor triggered the event and processes it accordingly.
		\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{c}
void handle_wakeup_reason(){
    if (wakeup_reason == ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_EXT1) {
        uint64_t status = esp_sleep_get_ext1_wakeup_status();
        if (status & (1ULL << 27)) {
            // Handle PIR sensor event
        }
        if (status & (1ULL << 33)) {
            // Handle Magnetic switch event
        }
    }
}
		\end{minted}
			\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

			
Note: I have deployed exactly one ESP with a Magnetic Switch and PIR sensor simultaneously in my apartment. It has been placed in the bedroom. The PIR sensor was pointing towards the bed area, and the magnetic switch was placed on the entrance door. The idea was to track the sleep time of the patient. If the doors remained open, the sensor was still active, and no bed area events were recorded. This was done on purpose because I know that every time the patient goes to sleep, he will close the door first.

\subsection{Single Code for All Sensors (1p)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generic Code Base for Multiple Sensors}
    
    \begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Describe how you achieved a generic code base for all your sensors devices. You can include code snippets.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Generic code for all devices was achieved by identifying the device based on its MAC address and configuring it accordingly.
			\item Each device needs to be specied in the `main.h` file with its device name, MAC address, ID, MQTT topic, security key, battery information availability, and room ID.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small]{c}
//Struct definition for device information
/**
 * @brief Represents the configuration and metadata for a device.
 *
 * This struct is used to define the properties of an ESP device, including its
 * name, MAC address, ID, MQTT topic, security key, and whether battery information

 * configurations within the system.
 */
 typedef struct {
    char* device_name;             // < Name of the device (e.g., "Living Room").
    uint8_t mac_address[6];        // < MAC address of the device (6 bytes).
    int device_id;                 // < Unique identifier for the device.

 */
void identify_device(const uint8_t* mac_address) {
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(ESPs) / sizeof(ESPs[0]); ++i) {
        if (memcmp(mac_address, ESPs[i].mac_address, sizeof(ESPs[i].mac_address)) == 0) {
            // Copy the device info into this_device
            memcpy(&this_device, &ESPs[i], sizeof(device_info_t));
            // Logging
            ESP_LOGI("*", "*********** Device identified as %s", this_device.device_name);
            return;
        }
    }
    ESP_LOGI("*", "Device not recognized.");
}
    \end{minted}

\label{introduction}

The introduction of a scientific work usually consists of the following
parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item motivation,
	\item issues or drawbacks with existing solutions of a problem at 
hand,
	\item overview of new contribution and rest of the paper.
\end{itemize}

In the motivation you should explain why a given topic is interesting
at all, and also, why solutions are important from a scientific point
of view. There already may be a lot of existing solutions. Thus, it
is important for the reader to understand the issues with these solutions,
and why they are not enough for e.g. a specific scenario.

After the motivation, you should explain the basic idea of your new
contribution to solve the problem at hand, and give a short overview
of how this works and why it is better than all other existing solutions.
Finally, a short overview to the rest of the work should be provided,
which may pick out the most important points. As any idea or solution
proposed must be shown to be valid and useful, every scientific paper
must have some evaluation and discussion. It may to useful to select
important results, and mention them already as last part of the
introduction, as motivation for the reader to read on. In summary,
a good introduction makes the reader so interested into the topic and
proposed new contributions that he cannot wait to read on.

\end{figure*}


\section{Basic Rules for Using Latex}

First, we want to refer to the figures and the introduction.
See Figure~\ref{TUM} for the first floating figure with column width,
and Figure~\ref{Fig2} for the one using the full page width.
And here, we want to put a reference to the introduction which is
Section~\ref{introduction}.

In translating this template from German to English, I decided to
stop here. There is not really much to get from the German text
following. Anything Latex-related can also be looked up on the
net. There is a {\it huge} number of tutorials, and so on.

Please do not use to much different font sizes and styles. It should
be completely enough to go to {\em italic mode} for emphasizing something,
such as newly introduced terms.
You can refer to other parts of your paper (e.g. see 
Sec.~\ref{introduction}).
Quoting in Latex is done ``this way''.
Further, you may have problems with punctation characters.
Most of them just need to be prefixed by a backslash, for others you may
temporarily switch to math mode:
\$ \& \% \# \{ \} [ ] \_ @ \S $<$ $>$ $\backslash$ @ \textasciitilde /
    
Talking about math mode: you can do some very nice things this way:

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\label{Pythagoras}
\end{equation}

Again, refering to this equation is easy (see Eq.~\ref{Pythagoras}).
If you do not need numbering for equations, use the {\em displaymath}
environment:

\begin{displaymath}
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\
\end{displaymath}

Short equations simply can be used within the regular text flow, such
as with $x \to \infty$. Obviously, math is fun with Latex.


\section{Enumerations}

Enumerations using bullet points:

\begin{itemize}
	\item this is the first item of this list of interesting facts,
	\item second item,
	\item and the last one.
\end{itemize}

They also can be numbered:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item item one,
	\item item two,
	\item item three.
\end{enumerate}

As shown, numbers always should be written out in the text, unless the
belong to a title or a formula.

\section{Literature}

At the end of your paper, you should have a nice list of used
literature. For scientific papers, this actually is needed. You always
use other works as base for your own. Usually, you are not the only
one thinking about a given difficult problem, so there is always
related work which {\em must} be cited if known to the author.

Further, if you want to copy relevant sentences from an
original paper, you {\em have} to cite them correctly, for example
in this way:

\begin{quote}
	``I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.''
	(T.J. Watson, IBM, 1943)
\end{quote}

The rest of the work (especially all the regular text) must be
written/phrased by you. If you write about some results or fact
stated in another paper, you should refer to it.
The `Analytical Engine'' --- a mechanical calculation machine ---
created by Charles Babbage in the year 1838 was based on the decimal
system
% use \cite to refer to papers from seminarpaper.bib
% this file is processed by bibtex, and it automatically adds numbering
\cite{Brom98}.

\section{Figures and Tables}

No need to understand the following text.

Figures can span either one column (see Figure~\ref{TUM}) or the full
page width (see Figure~\ref{Fig2}).
Latex automatically tries to find the best place for these floating
figures. To influence that, you may move the figure a bit to the front
of your text.
As can be seen in Figure~\ref{TUM}, using images usually results in very
bad quality. Better use vector formats: draw the figures with
{\em xfig} or {\em inkscape}, and save them as PDF. As example of
this procedure, see Figure~\ref{Fig2}).

% Narrow tables (just one column) have no * at the end
\begin{table*}

\begin{center}
% arguments:
% c = center
% l = left
% r = right (z. B. for cash)
% p = columns with fixed width, using block layout
% | = vertical line
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{2cm}|c|c|c|c|c|r|}
% horizontal line
\hline
% & means: next column
% \\ means: next row
	& Column 1 & Column 2 & Column 3 & Column 4& Column 5& Column 6& 
Amount\\
\hline
Row 1 & This column has a maximal width of 2 cm.& X & X& X& X& X& 126,00\\
\hline
Row 2 & & \multicolumn{3}{p{5cm}|}{This entry occupies three columns.}& X &X 
& 8,00\\
\hline
\multicolumn{7}{|l}{Sum} &134,00\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\caption{This is the caption of the table.}
% label is for this table
\label{Tab1}

\end{table*}

Similar to figures, tables can be referred to in the text (see 
Tab.~\ref{Tab1}). However, sometimes it is useful to embed tables directly in 
the regular text flow:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
	& Column 1 & Column 2 \\
\hline
Row 1 & & \\
Row 1 & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\section{Summary}
\label{summary}

The summary shortly repeats the core ideas and results from the
previous text. If the reader has problems understanding the summary
he knows that he should go back to the relevant sections.
Thus, the last section should consist of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item a summary,
	\item an evaluation of what was done, importance of this work,
	\item what is left, what still needs to be done,
	\item short outlook into the future.
\end{itemize}

Last but not least, we can explain anything missing yet in the evaluation
done in this paper. This allows to refer to what readers can expect from
authors in the future.
