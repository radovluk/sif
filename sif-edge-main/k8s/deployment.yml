          persistentVolumeClaim:              # an external (host) volumen to store the data locally. Since
            claimName: sif-edge-pv-claim      # the volumes can be shared across containers, k8s uses a combination
                                              # of Persistent Volumes (pv) and Persistent Volume Claims (pvc). The
                                              # pv create the host volume, while the pvc grants a container access to
                                              # an associated pv. It is important to denote: pv names are **global**, i.e.,
                                              # they are unique, while pvc are namespaced, i.e., pvc can share the same name
                                              # as long as they exist in different k8s' namespaces.
